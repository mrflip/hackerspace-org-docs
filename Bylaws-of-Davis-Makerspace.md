If the board approves, the corporation may send the report and any accompanying material sent pursuant to this section by electronic transmission.

## Annual Statement of Certain Transactions and Indemnifications

As part of the annual report, or as a separate document if no annual report is issued, the corporation shall, within 120 days after the end of the corporation's fiscal year, annually prepare and furnish to each director a statement of any transaction or indemnification of the following kind:

  * Any transaction
      * in which the corporation, or its parent or subsidiary, was a party,
      * in which an "interested person" had a direct or indirect material financial interest, and
      * which involved more than $50,000 or was one of several transactions with the same interested person involving, in the aggregate, more than $50,000. For this purpose, an "interested person" is either
          * any director or officer of the corporation, its parent or subsidiary (but mere common directorship shall not be considered such an interest); or
          * any holder of more than 10 percent of the [Voting Power][] of the corporation, its parent, or its subsidiary. The statement shall include a brief description of the transaction, the names of interested persons involved, their relationship to the corporation, the nature of their interest in the transaction and, if practicable, the amount of that interest, provided that if the transaction was with a partnership in which the interested person is a partner, only the interest of the partnership need be stated.
  * Any indemnifications or advances aggregating more than $10,000 paid during the fiscal year to any officer or director of the corporation under [Indemnification] of these bylaws, unless that indemnification has already been approved under Corporations Code section 5238(e)(2).

# Construction and Definitions

Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the masculine gender includes the feminine and neuter, the singular includes the plural, the plural includes the singular, and the term "person" includes both a legal entity and a natural person.

## Definitions

### Quorum

Attendance of all but one (1) of the directors currently in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business except adjournment.

Directors may waive participation in a meeting by submitting a notice of written consent.  This waiver is only valid for the specified meeting and reduces the number of directors needed to reach quorum for that meeting.

### Voting Power

All eligible voters present at a meeting, either in person or represented by a proxy, that choose to participate in a call to vote shall constitute the voting power for the issue under consideration.

### Consensus

The affirmative vote of all but one (1) of the non-interested [Voting Power][] represented at the meeting, entitled to vote and voting on any matter, shall be deemed an approval by consensus.  Every action taken or decision made by a consensus of the [Voting Power][] at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present shall be an act of the Corporation.

### Eligible Voter

Any director or officer of the Corporation is an eligible voter.  In addition, all persons of the general public shall be entitled to vote at any public meeting provided they have attended at least two (2) of the most recent three (3) public meetings.  Eligibility to vote on a particular action is forbidden if the person is deemed to be an interested party with respect to the action.

### Interested Party

An eligible voter shall be deemed an interested party if he or his immediate family is the subject of a vote or if he or his immediate family stands to gain financially from the outcome of the vote.

Any otherwise eligible voter who is an interested party with respect to a particular action called to vote is ineligible to participate in that vote.

# Amendment of Bylaws

The Board may adopt, amend or repeal bylaws. Such power is subject to the following limitations:

  * Where any provision of these Bylaws requires the vote of a larger proportion of the Directors than otherwise is required by law, such provision may not be altered, amended or repealed except by the vote of such greater number.
  * No amendment may extend the term of a Director beyond that for which such Director was elected.
  * Bylaws may only be adopted, amended or repealed subject to a vote by the [Voting Power][] at a [Public Meeting][] for which written notice of such meeting, setting forth the proposed bylaw revisions with explanations therefor, is given in accordance with these Bylaws.
