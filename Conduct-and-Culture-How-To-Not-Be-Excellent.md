# How to Not Be Excellent

There's lots of ways to be excellent. Unfortunately, there are also many ways to not be excellent. If you find yourself doing things on the list below, please **pause and reflect**: your actions are very likely not excellent.

Context matters, and so many of these actions can be excellent in a certain scenario: persevering in asking a close friend battling depression to go dancing, which they used to enjoy, is generous. Persisting in asking the cute hacker who just joined to go dancing — even when they've politely turned you down twice — is not excellent at best, and harassment at worst. Why not check with a friend, or your mom, or a board member or officer, or the other party in the scenario?

* Consumption of any hackerspace resource at a significantly higher rate than the typical member. For example:
  - Installing a cryptocurrency mining rig,
  - Occupying a whole shelf of the fridge,
  - Storing an entire tree under a table,
  - Taking up every workshop table to refinish fourteen table tops,
  - Running an extension cord out to your van every time you come to the space,
  - Permanently camping on a workshop table,
  - Parking (or living in) your car every day at the space,
  - Recharging a fleet of scooters from the space,
  - Running a public bittorrent server on our network.
  Many of these things can be converted from non-excellent to excellent by making a reasoned proposal to the board.

* Accessing another person's computer or account, or saving files of theirs that aren't obviously intended for the public. This is non-excellent, no matter how foolish or careless they were, no matter how arrogantly or badassly they present themselves. Just log them off or whatever and send a discrete note to remind them of good practice.

* Giving somebody a backrub without a verbal offer and an earnest positive reply.

* Using another member's tools without their explicit prior permission. In fact, it's probably not excellent to touch anything belonging to another hacker, including the hacker themself, without their permission.

* Offering your uninvited thoughts about what another person is wearing. Yes, in some cases this might be excellent or it might be very non-excellent. In particular, women in the workplace don't want your advice on how often they should smile or what kinds of dresses they should or shouldn't wear.

* Continuing to engage another person in online or offline communication even when they've asked you to stop.

* Holding conversations where you do most of the talking.

* Repeatedly asking another person to go on an activity with you, even if they politely decline.

* Scheduling your visits to the space to anticipate the times another member will be present.

* Referring to a person by other than the name or pronoun they prefer.

* Leaving hazardous materials unlabelled, or laying about, or in some cases even bringing them to the space.

* Using the workshop for more than an hour and *not* taking some action to make the space cleaner beyond what you did.

* Not asking for help when you feel even a little bit unsafe using a tool.

* Interrupting a person who is actively at work without asking them if it's a good time to chat

Also to consider: would you, in a moment of honesty, say "I have many gifts, but socially I am somewhat awkward"? That's fine! So would many or most of us! But those of us in that camp should be especially reflective about some of the social gray lines demonstrated above.
