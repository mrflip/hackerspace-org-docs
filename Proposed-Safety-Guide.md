* Tools can break or malfunction even in straightforward responsible use. If this happens, please report it.

* Tools are even more likely to break when used foolishly, or outside your expertise level. If this
happens, please also report it. We will work to repair the tool and help you understand what to do
next time. We may ask that you help subsidize repairs, but not outside your ability to afford
it.

* However: what is **absolutely unacceptable** is to notice a broken tool -- through your fault or not -- and fail to report it. Being a criminally negligent jerkface = instant ban.

* Accidents‐ Report everything!  We need to know for your safety.  Inform Supervisor or Trained
Personnel as soon as possible.  Minor incidents are important.  Accidents include any personal harm
or any damage done to machines or tools.

* Danger‐ Anything that appears to be an immediate or potential hazard should be dealt with
immediately.  Damaged equipment should be reported.

* Electrical Hazards‐ Keep out of any electrical control boxes.

* Moving Parts‐ Always keep your hands and other extremities away from all moving parts.

* Eye Protection­ Imperative when working with or around any tools and machinery, even if you are
not using the equipment.  Eye protection must be worn at ALL times when you are in the shop.  This
is the law; there are no exceptions!

* Face Shields­ Required when using lathe, but advised for all machinery.

* Ear Protection­ Available and advised.

* Dust Mask­ Available upon request.  Whenever working with wood, dust is produced and can be a
hazard.  Certain woods could contain harmful chemicals and Western Red Cedar has been attributed to
asthma and nasal cancer. Wear mask when creating high levels of saw dust and always keep work area
clean.

* No adjustments are to be made to any equipment except by the Shop Coordinator or
the Shop Monitor. No exceptions.

and all A&M facilities are smoke‐free.
* Respect your peers and faculty­ Be considerate and helpful towards
each other. No running, yelling, or other horseplay allowed.
* Electronics­ No headphones or cellular devices.

* Emergency
* Emergency Shut Down­ For use only in an emergency.  These buttons
cut power to all machines and outlets in the woodshop.  Shut down
switches are on all four walls.
* Fire­ Emergency pull is located to the right of the overhead door.
Extinguishers are throughout the shop.
* First Aid­ first aid is located next to office window.  Have personnel
assist you with all injuries.

III. Stationary Tool Safety
* Use machines only as intended.  If in doubt, ask for assistance and/or refer to
user manual.
* You should be informed in operation and safety procedure.  If you are not
comfortable with a machine, do not use it; ask for assistance.
* Focus on your work.  Look, listen, and be in control of what you are doing.  Do
not be distracted by or talk to others and do not distract others.
* Avoid accidental starting.
* All Safety guards and devices must be in place when operating machines.
* Do not overreach.
* Machine must be at rest before removing byproducts and turned “off” before
leaving.
* Return adjustable parts to rest position.  Machine should be clean and clear
before, during, and after it is used.
* Red knobs are not for adjustments.  These are for calibrations that should
only be done by Supervisor.
* Make all adjustments with the power box switched off!  .
* All adjustable parts should be secure before power is on.
* Do not use force.  The tool should do the work.  If it does not perform as you
expect, let trained personnel know.  There may be a better way.
* Stay within reach of power switch at all times.
* Check for worn and damaged parts.  Let trained personnel correct these
problems.  Do not attempt it yourself.
* Machinery should not be used to cut used lumber, plaster, or drywall.


### Band Saw

Band Saw‐ Free‐hand tool designed for cutting circles and curves.
Can also be used to rip and crosscut relatively small pieces of wood.
Safety­ Eye protection is required by law.  Do not be distracted by or talk
to others when operating machinery.
* Always keep hands and fingers 3” away from the cutting edge.
* Upper guide should be only 1/8” above material height.
* Only use wood that has flat surfaces.
* Hold wood firmly feeding it into blade at a moderate speed.
* Check band for good tension.
* Avoid backing wood out of an incomplete cut.
* Blade inhibits tight turns that could twist and break band.
* Clicking while blade is in motion indicates a hazard.  Inform trained
personnel.

1. Wheel guard doors must be closed and the
blade properly adjusted before turning on the
machine.
2. Adjust the upper guide assembly so it is no
more than1/4” above the work.
3. Allow the saw to reach full speed before
starting to feed the work.
4. The stock must be held flat on the table.
5. Feed the saw only as fast as the teeth will remove the wood easily.
6. MAINTAIN AT LEAST A FOUR-INCH MARGIN OF SAFETY. (This means that
the hands should always be at least four inches away from the blade when the saw is
running.)
7. Plan cuts to avoid backing out of curves, whenever possible. Stop the machine before
backing out of a long curved cut.
8. Make turns carefully and do not cut radii so small that the blade is twisted then broken.
9. Round stock should not be cut unless mounted firmly in a jig.
10. Do not let small pieces of wood accumulate around the blade. Move them out of the
way with a push stick or turn off the saw, wait till the blade stops, and then clear the
table.
11. If you hear a clicking noise, turn off the machine at once. This sound indicates a crack
in the blade. If the blade breaks, shut off the power and move away from the machine
until both wheels stop.
12. Turn off the machine as soon as you finish working. Sweep the table and the floor.
All scrap in the scrap bin. Lower the upper guide assembly.

* Check for dust accumulation. Heavy use can cause so much sawdust to gather inside the saw that it packs between the saw and the wheel, breaking it. This might harming you or your work, and will certainly be a pain in your ass and wallet.

need to sand.
* Keep wood flat on table while sanding.
* Do not apply excessive force.
* Check sanding surfaces for tears or holes.  Worn surfaces should be replaced


### . Compound Miter Saw‐ 10” Compound Slide Miter Saw

your hands six inches away from the path of the saw
blade.
2. Wear safety glasses.
3. Keep the blade guard in position at all times.
4. Hold stock firmly on the table and against the
fence.
5. After making the cut but before raising the saw
make sure that the blade has come to a complete stop.
6. When making multiple cuts of various angles do not move hands under the blade
whether it is moving or not.
7. When you complete your work at the saw lower the saw and lock it in place. Sweep the
workstation and the floor. All scrap goes in the scrap bin.

7. Stop the drill press before removing scrap pieces from the worktable.
8. Clean the tool and the work area when done.
1. Wear proper personal protection equipment. Safety
glasses or face shield are required. Wear hearing
protection that is appropriate for the level and
duration of the noise in the tool room. A dust mask is
recommended. Do not wear gloves.
2. Wear proper apparel. No loose fitting cloths or
neckties. No loose jewelry. Long hair must be
covered or tied back. Non-slip footwear is
recommended.
3. Keep the work area clean. Cluttered areas and benches invite accidents.
4. Most drills have a locking pin that holds the trigger “on” until disengaged. Make sure
that the trigger is in the “off” position before plugging in the drill to the power supply.
5. Disconnect power supply before changing or adjusting bit or attachments.
6. Select the bit or attachment suitable for the size of the drill and the work being done.
The most common sizes are those that take shanks up to 3/8” or 1/2” diameters.
7. Ensure that the bit or attachment is properly seated and tightened in the chuck. Remove
chuck key before starting drill.
Woodshop Safety Program

Unplug a tool that is not being used.
* Unplug tool before changing parts and making adjustments.  Be sure bits and
blades are secure before usage.  Turn switch to “OFF” before plugging into
socket.
