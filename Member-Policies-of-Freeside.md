## Finances

### Donations

Anyone can contribute time and energy towards Freeside and its projects, but such contributions cannot be claimed as donations for tax purposes.

Certain equipment or materials are never accepted as donations in any circumstances, such that they may be explicitly communicated to all Freeside members and visitors. This list will be maintained by Freeside operations, and is not considered to be exclusive.

In general and notwithstanding forbidden materials, small value donations (**under $250**) may be donated with simple notification to the [Safety and Risk](mailto:sr@freesideatlanta.org) (SR) team, and claims and issuance of a receipt are at the sole discretion of the donor.

Donors with large value donations (**over $250**) must contact the SR team for approval. A receipt will be issued to the donor. If the donor wishes to remain anonymous, the donation record will be changed to make the donor anonymous, after issuance of the receipt.

If a receipt is issued for the donor, the fair market value shall be the average of a search for a minimum of three similar items, and the search shall be kept on record and noted on the receipt issued. For most donations, this method or similar valuation should suffice. For larger value donations (**over $1000**) and where it may be difficult to locate comparables, a signed affidavit of an appraiser must be presented in lieu of fair market value search, and be kept on record.

Separately, the donation of large equipment or materials (in terms of dimensions, volume) where placement is a concern and may interfere with Freeside operations or projects requires the pre-approval of the SR team.

Certain equipment or materials must always be pre-approved by the SR team, such that these items may be explicitly communicated to all Freeside members and visitors. This list will be maintained by Freeside operations, and is not considered to be exclusive.

If a member drops off or facilitates a visitor to drop off unapproved equipment or materials, the member shall be tasked with its removal from the space, and may be subject to removal costs or fines at the discretion of the SR team.

Donation records shall be kept indefinitely.

### Past Due Membership Process

After 30 days of non-payment, the member is informed by email that they are past due. The membership is moved to not in good standing. Some member rights and privileges are suspended, as dictated by the by-laws.

After 60 days of non-payment, the member is sent a second email. Membership status is moved to probationary. Additional member rights and privileges are suspended, as dictated by the by-laws.

All non-payment notification emails should cc the Board of Directors mailing list.
Members that pay their account balance in full before termination have all their membership rights and privileges restored.

A membership is reviewed by the Board of Directors and after a quorum vote terminated after 90 days of non-payment. Termination of membership does not absolve an individual from the obligation to pay their membership balance.

Individuals terminated in this manner are eligible to reapply for membership when their account balance is paid in full.

**DRAFT CHANGE PROPOSAL — Randy Farmer, 4/9/2015**

Dues for the current month are due on the first day of that month, and late the first day of the following month.

On the first day of the first month that past dues have not been paid in full:

* The member is informed by email that they are one month past due
* A one month [Late Fee](https://wiki.freesideatlanta.org/index.php?title=Late_Fee&action=edit&redlink=1) is assessed on the members dues
* Probationary members have their access cards disabled. They remain members but must pay balance in full to regain 24/7 access privileges
* Probationary members are considered Not in Good Standing, as this applies to other policies and the bylaws of the organization
* The Treasurer informs the Board of which Probationary Members are at risk for termination next month

On the first day of the second month that past dues have not been paid in full:

* The member is sent a second email informing them they are two months past due
* Another one month Late Fee is assessed on the members dues
* Probationary members are terminated. They may reapply for membership once past due balances have been paid
* The Secretary records the termination in the official Membership Book
* Member have their access cards disabled. They remain members but must pay balance in full to regain 24/7 access privileges
* Members are considered Not in Good Standing, as this applies to other policies and the bylaws of the organization
* The Treasurer informs the Board of which Members are at risk for termination next month

On the first day of the third month that past dues have not been paid in full:

* The member is sent a final email informing them they are three months past due
* Another one month Late Fee is assessed on the members dues
* Membership for members is terminated. Members may reapply for membership once past due balances have been paid
* The Secretary records the termination in the official Membership Book

Members may voluntarily terminate their membership at any time and avoid accruing additional dues. You should notify the Treasurer, another Officer, or Director of this intent before the end of the month to avoid owing dues for next month.

Termination of membership (voluntary or otherwise) does not absolve an individual from the obligation to pay their past balance. A majority action of the Board is required to forgive past balances.

Freeside understands that situations occur that can prevent someone from being able to make payment when they’re due. Please contact the Treasurer, another Officer, or Director if you find yourself in one of these situations. Options may be available to prevent termination of your membership.

### Payment Schedule

The membership dues are due by the last Friday of the month the individual is a member of Freeside. A new member’s payment schedule starts with the first full month of membership.

If a member joins the week of the last Friday of the month, then the dues aren’t due until the last Friday of the next month.

Membership dues are considered late on the 1st of the month following the previous month of non-payment.

### Prepayments

A prepayment discount of 5% is offered as an incentive for a single payment of one year’s dues at the full rate (the annual dues payment or the prepayment). The discount is only offered to the prepayment if it is made with cash, check, or money order.

Refunds are only available for the prepayment, in part or in whole, on a case-by-case basis with approval from the Board of Directors.

The member locks the prepayment amount at the full rate at the time of prepayment, so future changes to the full rate require no additional payments or credits issued to the member.

The prepayment covers 12 months of membership, from the day of the prepayment to the same day on the next year.

### Reimbursement

Only Freeside members may be reimbursed for approved expenses. To avoid conflict of interest, reimbursement is not allowed for member/member transactions, or in cases where a member has a relationship to the seller, i.e., friend, family, employer. Such transactions must occur through Freeside’s procurement process.

A member is required to present the expenses to the [SR team](mailto:sr@freesideatlanta.org) as an itemized list with a printed receipt of the transaction(s). If a printed receipt is not available, e.g., a cash transaction for used equipment, then the seller must sign an affidavit of the transaction with their contact information provided.

For small expenses (<$50) reimbursement may be issued with the approval of an officer.
For large expenses (>$50), or any entertainment expenses, reimbursement requires pre-approval of the [Board of Directors](mailto:bod@freesideatlanta.org) prior to purchase.

Transactions for larger expenses (>$500) must go through Freeside’s procurement process.
The Treasurer shall issue reimbursement by check to a member when the requirements for reimbursement are met. A receipt of the reimbursement shall be issued and kept on record, and include the member’s name and the amount of reimbursement.

Records of reimbursements shall be kept indefinitely.

### Starving Hacker Program

The Starving Hacker Program (SHP) allows an individual to pay a reduced membership rate at Freeside, if they meet certain qualifications. The base rate for an SHP member is determined by the Treasurer. This will typically be half the normal dues rate but can be more or less than that amount but always less than full membership amount.

To qualify for the Starving Hacker program (and its reduced rate) you must meet and provide documentation for one of the following criteria:

* A full time student at an accredited educational program
* Unemployed or retired
* Temporarily or permanently disabled
* Work full time in a civil service role (public school teacher, social worker, etc)
To continue to qualify for the Starving Hacker program you must:
* Make prepayments, or setup recurring payment and
* Participate in at least one build-out/clean-up day a quarter
In addition to these, to maintain qualification you must also meet one of the following requirements:
* Teach a class that adds the equivalent revenue of half the regular membership rate
* Contribute time or value to a project that adds the equivalent of half the regular membership rate
* Make at least one blog post per month, or otherwise add significant content to our online presence
* Participation in the Starving Hacker program will be evaluated per quarter.

Any changes to the member’s qualifying status must be reported to the Treasurer within 60 days of the change. Failure to report the change will result in the member’s dues reverting to the standard rate for the period of time starting when the change occurred (in other words, you will pay back dues at the full membership rate.)

## Membership

### Access Cards

Upon joining Freeside Atlanta, new members are issued an RFID access badge or token that allows 24/7 access to the front door, the rear garage entrance, and member storage. These access points are always available to members that are part of the group members when the access control list (ACL) is generated for the node that operates the access point.

The card’s programmed locationid and tokenid (together, informally called the tokenid) are recorded into a centralized database and used to generate ACLs for nodes that operate other access points, such as the server room, the tool room, and the tool box. These access points are granted if the member has membership to other groups, like it-staff or lathe-operators, for example.

If a member loses the access card and needs a replacement, the cost is $5 to get a new badge or token.

It is the member’s responsibility to notify the Treasurer or IT when their card is lost, so the card can be disabled.

### Censure, Probation, and Termination

Members that violate Freeside policies, rules, or the code of conduct may be subject to disciplinary action by Officers and/or the Board of Directors, which may affect their membership status, rights, and privileges.

A Freeside policy may be written to include specific outcomes to violations of that policy. For example, the Past Due Membership Process outlines how membership rights and privileges are revoked over time for non-payment of membership dues, as well as ways to restore those rights and privileges. Another example is how the Drug and Alcohol Policy calls for the expulsion and termination of members that serve alcohol to minors.

In general, this policy seeks to assign responsibilities for disciplinary action against members, as well as describe the burden of proof and the process by which membership status transitions and how member rights, privileges are revoked and restored.

#### Definitions

*Censure*- an official statement by the Freeside leadership that informs a member that they are in violation of policies, rules, or the code of conduct.
*Good Standing*- a state of membership, in which a member meets the obligations of membership. These obligations are defined by the Freeside by-laws.
*Probation*- a state of membership where the member has some or all member rights and privileges revoked as defined by censure on record.
*Termination*- the act of removing an individual from Freeside membership, by Freeside leadership, voluntary resignation, or as defined in specific policies.

#### Responsibilities

It is the responsibility of the Officers to censure individual members for violating policy, rules, or the code of conduct. Officers are responsible for reporting each censure at the following Board of Directors meeting. Officers are responsible for keeping a record of each censure.

It is the responsibility of the Board of Directors to place a member into probationary status, either automatically by the terms and conditions of approved policy, or via decision by majority vote. In the case of automatic placement, it is the responsibility of the Officers to properly record the violation(s), and to report the event to the Board of Directors.

It is the responsibility of the Board of Directors to terminate a member, either automatically by the terms and conditions of approved policy, or via decision by majority vote. It is the responsibility of the Board of Directors to record the violation(s).

It is the responsibility of the Officers to carry out the terms of approved policy, to revoke the member’s privileges as applicable.

It is the responsibility and discretion of the Treasurer to reconcile or pursue outstanding balances for members that elect to terminate.

#### Burden of Proof

Censure is at the discretion of each Officer. A statement of censure, by definition, must specify cause and state the specific violation of policy, rules, or code of conduct.

A member may be put into probationary status automatically, by the terms and conditions of approved policy. The violation(s) are recorded and reported to the Board of Directors.

There are situations that can occur that merit placing a member into probationary status, but for which there is no current policy that covers the violation(s), or for which it is impossible to write and approve a policy that covers the situation. In these cases, the Board of Directors must record the violations and take a majority vote to place a member into probation.

The same burden of proof applies to the termination of a member. The only difference is that the Board of Directors record the violation(s) that led to the member termination.

A history of censure is sufficient in whole or in part as burden of proof for placing a member in probation or terminating a membership.

#### Appeals

A member may appeal any censure to the Board of Directors. A censure may be expunged by majority vote of the Board of Directors.

A member may appeal probationary status to the Board of Directors. A member can be removed from probation by majority vote of the Board of Directors.

There is no appeal for termination. A member must reapply for membership.

#### Member Resignation
A member may terminate their Freeside membership at any time, by notifying an Officer, in writing (the resignation).

The member has until the end of the month in which they resign to clear out their property from the space. After the end of the month, any remaining property is forfeit to Freeside.

#### Examples

A member has repeatedly taken materials and parts out of Freeside for personal projects, without really returning anything back to the space. Officers dealt with the situation by verbal warnings first, but then the problem continued, so Officers started to censure the member. After report(s) to the Board of Directors, the Board votes to revoke the member’s access to member storage, and revoke member access to IT infrastructure (Linux accounts). The Treasurer as Officer and acting head of IT revokes access to the services (or the Treasurer may instruct one of the IT staff to do this) . The member still has voting rights, and 24/7 access to other areas of the space - and the probationary period is set to one month. The behavior stops and the member’s full access is restored the following month (as defined by censure). The Treasurer directs the IT staff to restore access to Freeside services, per the Board’s instructions.

### Member Storage

In general, Freeside does not provide long-term storage solutions for its members’ equipment and projects. However, exceptions can be made for equipment, tools, consumables, and raw materials that add value to the space and other members.

As part of any membership, members are granted storage space with dimensions of approximately 23x32x12in (Room for two standard 12 gallon totes, one in front, one in back). Members are responsible for providing their own storage bins, and securing their belongings in them. No loose storage will be permitted. Freeside members are expected to respect other members’ property in member storage.

Restricted materials are not allowed to be stored in member storage. The list of these materials is maintained by the SR team.

If a member stores equipment, tools, consumables, or raw materials in excess of their member storage or SR-approved storage, then Freeside will send the member a notification to remove anything in excess storage, subject to the terms of the notification.

When membership is terminated, the former member is notified to remove their property, subject to the terms of the notification(s). Notifications are given upon termination, and then 2 weeks after the first notice, a second notice is given.

If a member notified in this manner does not remove their property subject to the terms of the notification, then the property is considered forfeit and may be removed, sold, or absorbed by Freeside (after a minimum of 30 days).

Member storage is a sacred area of the space. Nobody messes with anybody else’s stuff in member storage. Ever. Each member gets a tote to store their stuff and a bit of temporary shelf space for personal projects if necessary.

### Project Storage

In general, Freeside promotes the use of its space for member-driven projects.

Members and their guests are free to work on collaborative projects in any location of Freeside at any time (barring any scheduling conflicts with classes, events or other projects), and put away works in progress in our project storage area.

In order to help prevent scheduling conflicts, it is encouraged to work with the Activities and Culture (AC) team to find out the availability of certain areas.

For long-term or larger projects that can’t be easily put away in project storage, the project lead should contact the AC team for approval to allocate storage space. In some cases, a storage fee might be charged at the discretion of the AC team.

Projects that have long-term storage negotiated in this way must provide a project end date to the AC team. On this date, the project lead can renegotiate storage terms with the AC team. Projects that exceed the end date are subject to the same notification requirements as excess member storage.

### Garage Workshop Policy

In short:

* East Bay is the autobay “Proper” for up to 7 day long auto projects.
* West Bay is empty space for Loading and Unloading as well as Machine shop activities. It serves as a second autobay (24 hour max) when the East bay is occupied.
* Autobay is managed by the Member-appointed “Zone Manager”

In Detail:

The East roll up door is the Auto Bay (Formally). It can be reserved for periods of up to one week without the need of direct approval of Appointed Zone Manager (To be named, otherwise BOD appointment until then). If it is not reserved, it can be used on a first come first served basis. If another person wants to use the autobay, they must announce their intentions and remove their vehicle when they have reached their time limit.

**Example 1**: Mike Hackerschmidt announces to the FS Members Group, and CCs the Zone Manager, that he’ll be using the autobay for the next 7 days. Mike must move his vehicle when the 7 days are up, therefore possession does not roll onto 10, 15, 25 days, etc. If nobody has announced the use of the autobay during that time, Mike can “reapply” to use it again.

The West bay is reserved primarily for loading and unloading, but will be kept clean and empty. If the East auto bay is occupied, it can be used for short term auto repairs (less than 24 hours).

**Example 2**: Sally Tinkerstein wants to change the oil of her vehicle, but must wait until Mike Hackerschmidt’s 7 days are up. However, if the West bay is available, she can reserve it for a quick 24 hour period of time to do so.

The rear of the West bay (away from the doors) will be the metal working area, with the mill/lathe/welders/molding/etc. The kiln could be located on a moving platform, and placed in/near the west bay when it’s in use.

All tools should be cleaned and put away after use. Extension cords should be unplugged, wrapped, and hung. Air hoses should be properly coiled “over under”. Any oil spills should be either cleaned, or soaked in oil absorber and cleaned within 48 hours (to give the absorber time to work). The floor should be swept as necessary.

Any equipment failures should be promptly reported (ex: a floor jack that stops working) so that repairs can be made.

This makes the West auto bay a multi-use area. It can be used for the kiln, metal working, or auto repairs.

The primary purpose of the Zone Manager is for conflict prevention and conflict resolution. It is important that he/she be included in autobay discussions or queries and is provided contact information of autobay users for Members are encouraged to conduct themselves professionally and avoid unnecessary episodes.

**Example 3**: Mike Hackerschmidt has 3 more days on his reservation of the autobay, but Sally wants to quickly change the oil in her vehicle without cramping the Lathe-Jockeys hard at work in the West Bay. She is able to contact the zone manager to see if Mike doesn’t mind sharing the East bay for one hour. Mike may or may not choose to permit his vehicle to be moved during this brief period of time.

Please note: Sally, Mike, and the Zone Manager are “in the loop” and Mike’s reservation is respectfully honored.

## Conduct

### Anti-Discrimination

Freeside Technology Spaces does not and shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion (creed), gender, gender expression, age, national origin (ancestry), disability, marital status, sexual orientation, or military status, in any of its activities or operations.

### Anti-Harassment

Freeside Technology Spaces (Freeside) is dedicated to providing a harassment-free hackerspace experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of members, guests, or visitors in any form. Sexual language and sexually explicit imagery is not appropriate for any Freeside space, including Freeside-related events. Members, guests, and visitors violating these rules may be expelled from the space or event at the discretion of the Officers and Directors.

Harassment covers a wide range of behaviours of an offensive nature. It is commonly understood as behaviour intended to disturb or upset, and it is characteristically repetitive. In the legal sense, it is intentional behaviour which is found threatening or disturbing. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexually explicit images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members, guests, and visitors asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a member engages in harassing behavior, Freeside Officers and Directors may take any action they deem appropriate, including but not limited to: censure, expulsion from the space, and/or termination of membership.
In an emergency, please call 911. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an Officer or Director immediately. You can reach us at either:

* Officers email: [officers@freesideatlanta.org](mailto:officers@freesideatlanta.org%7C)
* Directors email: [bod@freesideatlanta.org](mailto:bod@freesideatlanta.org%7C)

Freeside will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, call taxis, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe at our space and events. We value our visitors and members.

* In an emergency, please call 911. We are in the City of Atlanta jurisdiction.

### Conflict of Interest

#### ARTICLE I: PURPOSES

The purpose of the conflict of interest policy is to protect the corporation’s tax-exempt interest when it is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of an officer or director of the corporation or might result in a possible excess benefit transaction.  The policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit and charitable organizations.

#### ARTICLE II: DEFINITIONS

* 2.1   Interested Person
Any director, principal officer, or member of a committee with governing board delegated powers, who has a direct or indirect financial interest, as defined below, is an interested person.

* 2.2   Financial Interest
A person has a financial interest if the person has, directly or indirectly, through business, investment, or family:
  - (a)  An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which the corporation has a transaction or arrangement,
  - (b)  A compensation arrangement with the corporation or with any entity or individual with which the corporation has a transaction or arrangement, or
  - (c)  A potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation arrangement with, any entity or individual with which the corporation is negotiating a transaction or arrangement.

Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts or favors that are not insubstantial.  A financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest.  Under Article III, Section 2, a person who has a financial interest may have a conflict of interest only if the appropriate governing board or committee decides that a conflict of interest exists.

#### ARTICLE III: PROCEDURES


* 3.1   Duty to Disclose
In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an interested person must disclose the existence of the financial interest and be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the directors and members of committees with governing board delegated powers considering the proposed transaction or arrangement

* 3.2  Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists
After disclosure of the financial interest and all material facts, and after any discussion with the interested person, he/she shall leave the governing board or committee meeting while the determination of a conflict of interest is discussed and voted upon.  The remaining board or committee members shall decide if a conflict of interest exists.

* 3.3   Procedures for Addressing the Conflict of Interest
  - (a)   An interested person may make a presentation at the governing board or committee meeting, but after the presentation, he/she shall leave the meeting during the discussion of, and the vote on, the transaction or arrangement involving the possible conflict of interest.
  - (b)  The chairperson of the governing board or committee shall, if appropriate, appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement.
  - (c)   After exercising due diligence, the governing board or committee shall determine whether the corporation can obtain with reasonable efforts a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest.
  - (d)  If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably possible under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest, the governing board or committee shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in the corporation’s best interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable. In conformity with the above determination it shall make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or arrangement.

* 3.4  Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy
  - (a)  If the governing board or committee has reasonable cause to believe a member has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall inform the member of the basis for such belief and afford the member an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose.
  - (b)  If, after hearing the member’s response and after making further investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the governing board or committee determines the member has failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action.

#### ARTICLE IV: RECORDS OF PROCEEDINGS

* 4.1   Minutes
The minutes of the governing board and all committees with board delegated powers shall contain:
  - (a)  The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to have a financial interest in connection with an actual or possible conflict of interest, the nature of the financial interest, any action taken to determine whether a conflict of interest was present, and the governing board’s or committee’s decision as to whether a conflict of interest in fact existed.
  - (b)  The names of the persons who were present for discussions and votes relating to the transaction or arrangement, the content of the discussion, including any alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement, and a record of any votes taken in connection with the proceedings.

#### ARTICLE V: COMPENSATION

* 5.1   A voting member of the governing board who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the corporation for services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to that member’s compensation.

* 5.2   A voting member of any committee whose jurisdiction includes compensation matters and who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the corporation for services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to that member’s compensation.

* 5.3.  No voting member of the governing board or any committee whose jurisdiction includes compensation matters and who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the corporation, either individually or collectively, is prohibited from providing information to any committee regarding compensation.

#### ARTICLE VI: ANNUAL STATEMENTS

Each director, principal officer and member of a committee with governing board delegated powers shall annually sign a statement which affirms such person:'

* (a)   Has received a copy of the conflicts of interest policy,
* (b)   Has read and understands the policy,
* (c)   Has agreed to comply with the policy, and
* (d)   Understands that the corporation is charitable and in order to maintain its federal tax exemption it must engage primarily in activities which accomplish one or more of its tax-exempt purposes.

#### ARTICLE VII: PERIODIC REVIEWS

To ensure the corporation operates in a manner consistent with charitable purposes and does not engage in activities that could jeopardize its tax-exempt status, periodic reviews shall be conducted.  The periodic reviews shall, at a minimum, include the following subjects:
* (a)  Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based on competent survey information and the result of arm’s length bargaining.
* (b)  Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management corporations conform to the corporation’s written policies, are properly recorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for goods and services, further charitable purposes and do not result in inurement, impermissible private benefit or in an excess benefit transaction.

#### ARTICLE VIII: USE OF OUTSIDE EXPERTS

When conducting the periodic reviews as provided for in Article VII, the corporation may, but need not, use outside advisors.  If outside experts are used, their use shall not relieve the governing board of its responsibility for ensuring periodic reviews are conducted.


### Equal Opportunity Employment

Freeside Technology Spaces is an equal opportunity employer. We will not discriminate and will take affirmative action measures to ensure against discrimination in employment, recruitment, advertisements for employment, compensation, termination, upgrading, promotions, and other conditions of employment against any employee or job applicant on the basis of race, color, gender, national origin, age, religion, creed, disability, veteran’s status, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.

### Organizational Governance

In order to act as a cohesive organization, Freeside Officers, Directors and members will document, collaborate, and communicate decisions and actions taken that affect other members, or the organization as a whole.

No Officer or Director will take any actions representing Freeside outside of their normal assigned duties without notifying the Board and Officers in a timely manner. Unless in response to an emergency situation that requires immediate action (examples: active hacking, vandalism, matter of member or guest safety) the Officer or Director should attempt to contact and collaborate with another Officer or Director on the proper course prior to taking any action.

No member shall conduct business as Freeside in an official capacity without prior and specific permission of the Board. The Secretary will document the scope of any such permission granted.

## Safety and Compliance

8. If you break it or find it broken, fix it, or seek help from someone who can. A broken tool is a dangerous tool. Don’t leave it broken without notifying the members list or filling out the Maintenance Report form*, putting a sign on it, and/or locking it out so it cannot be used until repaired.
9. **Never**use damaged or malfunctioning equipment.
10. **Disconnect power**before adjusting, changing blades, repairing or moving any tool.
11. If you don’t know how to use a tool, find someone to show you how first (see Zone Captain, check Wiki, ask on Members mailing list, etc).
12. Only use tools for their intended purpose. Tools that have been modified for a different/additional purposes need to be clearly labeled and documented.
13. **Keep a safe path clear**to all exits and emergency equipment, including all fire extinguishers..
14. Flammable, poisonous, radioactive, hazardous materials, and biological samples must be properly stored and labelled. If you bring it into the space you are responsible for**proper storage, labeling**AND for providing two copies of an**MSDS**(One to be stored with the material, one in the central file). Do not use the kitchen or food prep areas for chemistry or biology work. Never store any non-food items in a food container.
15. You are responsible for the**safe**AND**legal disposal**of all waste materials from your projects. Used automotive fluids, batteries, and the like should be removed and taken for proper recycling or disposal.
16. All spills must be addressed immediately. Cat litter, sawdust, paper towels, etc. are available. Think ahead and place a catch pan under anything likely to spill. For hazardous materials, attempt to contain, cordon of the affected area, alert the membership of the issue, and seek help to properly clean it up.
17. Do not leave oily rags on the floor or in piles. Dispose of these in a proper container (metal can with a lid, or special rag holders in the auto bays)
18. When you’re done with it,**clean it up**and**put it back where it goes**. If you don’t know where it goes, put it back where you found it and find out where it should go next time. Clean and reset stationary power tools to a safe state. Workspace tables should be cleared.
19. Before you leave,**move your project into ** [member storage](https://wiki.freesideatlanta.org/fs/Member_Storage) , [short term project storage](https://wiki.freesideatlanta.org/fs/Short_term_project_storage) , or**remove it from the space**. If you have to leave something out (24 hours maximum), put a note on it with your contact information. [Longer term project storage](https://wiki.freesideatlanta.org/fs/Policy_MemberStorage) exceeding your member storage must be arranged with the Projects and Inventory team.
20. If you find a project left out, leave it alone if possible. If not, carefully relocate it to [short term project storage](https://wiki.freesideatlanta.org/fs/Short_term_project_storage) .
21. If your project is going to create dust, try to control it (shop vac, dust collector for wood tools only, physical barriers to limit spreading to a smaller area, do work in the shop, not the front where possible).**Sweep up**the work surfaces, tools, and floor around you when you’re done.
22. **Welding masks are required**for anyone using or observing a welder. You are also required to place a UV blocking curtain or solid objects between welding and other shop users to protect them from UV exposure. Let others present know you are welding and inform them how to safely avoid dangerous exposure.
23. Spray painting (and other materials)**must be done outside**to avoid overspray damaging tools and equipment and to minimize health and flammability issues. (*If we want to be able to paint inside, we need an area dedicated to this, and a paint spray fan/filter system constructed).
24. The equipment and power tools are not storage locations, workbenches, ladders, chairs, etc. Do not place drinks, food, works in progress, excess materials, etc on any piece of equipment. Do not use equipment to support projects being painted, sanded, or for any other task unrelated to that tool.
25. Read manuals, signs, and wiki pages for tool and machine specific rules.
26. The shop is for use by Freeside members. [Guests](https://wiki.freesideatlanta.org/fs/Policy_MemberGuests) may use the shop only under the direct supervision of a member, who is responsible for ensuring that all safety rules are observed.

### Age Restrictions

#### Definitions

The minimum age of membership is 18.

# Restricted Areas Defined
Workshop: From the north wall of the member storage/loft to the garage doors. Includes woodshop, toolroom, CNC, and auto bays.
Attic: To the right of the entrance to the loft.

## Caution Areas Defined
Chemistry/Loft: There are two primary areas, one in the classroom, the second in the loft (once the biolab is setup). These areas are known to have potentially dangerous chemicals out in the open, and are not located in restricted areas.
# Requirements

Guardians of any person under 18 must sign a waiver on their behalf, and present the waiver to an officer. Guardians present with any children under 14 must be shown the location of MSDS binders and notified of the caution areas.
No member is obligated to supervise anyone under 18 in any of the restricted spaces.
# Restrictions
* Children under the age of 14 are never allowed in any of the restricted areas without member supervision while dangerous equipment is running.
* Children under the age of 14 with member supervision are allowed in the workshop for Freeside events with proper safety gear.
* Children under the age of 14 are not allowed to use any power tool or cutting tool anywhere at Freeside without direct 1:1 supervision of a member, guardian (with member approval), or Freeside sponsored instructor as part of a demonstration or class.
* Youth between the ages of 14 and 17 are allowed in the restricted areas with member supervision and proper safety gear.
*
# Examples
Timothy is a 10 year old with a crutch and a tin cup. He is never allowed in the workshop area without a member, if the danger sign is lit and/or dangerous equipment is running.

Timothy is allowed to scamper out the rear garage door to take a shortcut to MARTA via a hole in the fence, as long as a member escorts him out.

Later that week, a member is going to demo how to weld crutches out of scrap metal to the group Atlanta Street Urchin Little Achievers (ASULA) as part of a fundraiser, and Timothy is allowed in the back with the group to see the sparks fly with UV protection goggles on.

When the demo is over, Timothy goes back to the front of the space. He grabs a clear plastic container of white powder labeled “Ground Turkey” out of the chemistry lab and starts drawing shapes in the powder. The group guide and guardian notices, and looks up the material in the MSDS binder to see if it is toxic and medical attention is warranted.

Some time passes and now Timothy is 16, and drives his guardian’s Escalade to Freeside. The guardian presents a signed waiver to an officer. Timothy is allowed in the workshop to build wooden ducks with secret compartments while a member is present.

### Drugs and Alcohol

Anyone under the age of 21 caught drinking alcohol or intoxicated or anyone caught serving alcohol to anyone under the age of 21 at Freeside will be expelled from the space. If that person is a member, they will have their membership immediately terminated. Members terminated in this manner can only renew membership on or after their 21st birthday and at the discretion of the Board.
Any member who serves anyone under the age of 21 will be expelled from the space and their membership terminated.
Any alcohol left in the space is the property of the member that brought it in and should be stored in Member storage.
The use of illegal drugs at Freeside is prohibited. Anyone caught using illegal drugs at Freeside will be expelled. If that person is a member, they will have their membership immediately terminated.

### Member’s Guests

Members are free to bring guests to Freeside. While hosting a guest, the member must remain present at Freeside. You may only leave a guest at Freeside if another member present voluntarily/willingly assumes the duties of host. Member access cards/codes/passwords/keys are never to be given to a guest.
Members have a responsibility to:
* inform their guests about risks at Freeside
* know the locations of safety equipment (fire extinguishers, first aid, exits, etc.)
* inform their guests about Freeside rules and policies
* supervise the conduct of their guests
* never leave a guest alone in the space (without a member host), or allow a guest into a secured or dangerous area without member supervision
Guests have a responsibility to:
* sign the liability waiver
* only operate machinery under supervision of a member
* follow safety rules for the workshop (i.e. eye protection)
* abide by all Freeside rules and policies
The following rules only apply to member guests:
* Guests are not allowed to sleep at Freeside except in the case of a scheduled all-night Freeside project
* Guests are never allowed to remove tools, equipment, or supplies from Freeside without prior approval from an officer or director

### Pets

The environment of Freeside Atlanta is not safe for pets, which includes hazards to animals such as metal shavings on the shop floor, sharp objects throughout the space, and loud machinery and power tools. In such an environment, pets may become agitated and pose a danger to visitors, other members, and Freeside staff.
All pets are prohibited inside all areas of Freeside facilities.
Service animals are exempt from this restriction.

### Loanation

Freeside’s workshop has historically grown on the generosity of our members and community loaning equipment and tools to the space. While we prefer to receive these items as [Donations](https://wiki.freesideatlanta.org/fs/Donations) (we are a 501(c)(3) non-profit and your donation can be tax deductible) there are still some items of large value and utility that we are happy to accept on loan.
In order to ensure that these items are made accessible to our members and the public (through events, classes, and projects), and to ensure that they are used in line with the owner’s wishes, Freeside requires that the owners of loaned equipment enter into a Loanation Agreement. Such an agreement will outline the terms and conditions of the equipment loan, including restrictions and conditions of access to the equipment.
In general, the more open the access to the equipment, the simpler the agreement will be. Usage restrictions placed upon a piece of equipment will require that certain other conditions to be met (such as requiring that periodic training being offered) in order to ensure that a piece of equipment is kept accessible.
Other conditions of the agreement may specify the terms of continued access, or timelines for removal should the loaner cease to be a Member in Good Standing, or either the loaner or the Freeside Board chooses to terminate the agreement.
The conditions of a specific agreement will be determined between the loaner and the Freeside Board, recorded by the Secretary, and reviewed periodically (at least annually).
A sample [Loanation Agreement](https://wiki.freesideatlanta.org/fs/Loanation_Agreement) is available.

### Loanation Agreement

#### General condition of the Equipment

* Hold Harmless ( owner shall insure, freeside not responsible for damage)
* Notice before removing the item from the space (30/60 days)?
* Able to remove the item within a specific time frame is necessary (30/60 days?) notified by Board.
* Agreement to create and fill out the wiki page on the item,
* lay out the expectation on member usage.
* Charging for use?
* Training required?
* One on one signoff?
* Member provides own tooling, etc?

#### Access Control, Security, Monitoring

* Costs for implementing or integrating into Freeside Infrastructure would be up to the member to provide
	* access control system
	* installation of additional camera to cover
	* climate control
	* power outlet needs

(Board or members may decide to cover or chip in on a case by case basis.) (Ditto for costs to move the equipment in, and for removal.)

#### Specification Of Space Utilization

* Do not relocating it within the space without prior approval
* The Project and Storage team, and the Safety and Risk team reserves the right to inspect and lock out at any time if there is a safety issue with a piece of equipment, or to inspect prior to accepting into the space as a loanation.

This sounds like a great outline to me. I would also like a clause requiring periodic training (minimum quarterly?) be offered for devices that have a lockout or expectations of training (which should be the same). It seems Paul is in general good about being available to train on the lathe, but there have been times when this was not available on machines.

I’d also like a clause around being in sufficiently good repair. I think if a device is down for an extended period of time, then it should be required that it be removed. (I’m thinking if a device isn’t functioning for 60 days, then perhaps the owner gets 30 days to repair or move it).

I think that’s all fair. The training doesn’t have to be from the owner either. They can designate others qualified to do one-on-ones or training classes.

#### Training

* At least one training session within the first 60 days of bringing it into the space (gives time to get it set up, work out kinks, etc), and then minimum 2 others in the first year after that? I know I’d have a hard time committing to once a quarter. After the first year, let the Board review the usage, popularity, and demand and availability of training?

#### Renewal

* A one year anniversary checkup and agreement renewal.


## Classes

This policy is to create a standard for how class payments are handled so that Freeside can communicate an official stance on classes that is clear and concise.
We’ve benchmarked a few other spaces (with a specific focus on Artisan’s Asylum) to create a clear plan for organizing and hosting classes at the space. We’ve also spent about a year experimenting with different strategies for organizing, promoting and charging for classes.
This document is a result of that work, which we’ve consolidated into a plan for hosting classes that is fair and easy to understand.

# How much to charge
The price of a class is set by the teacher in the form of an hourly rate. This allows us to see our classes on a level playing field. However, class fees are advertised as the total rate and not the hourly rate. Typically, classes have been hosted at Freeside at rates between $5 and $20 per hour. In general, more advanced classes require smaller class size and so higher rates are recommended. This is at the discretion of the Teacher.

# Division of revenue
The Teacher receives 50% of the FULL amount charged for the class. If the class costs a student $20, the teacher receives $10. The Teacher does bear the cost of fees to transfer payments to them. So they receive $10 if paid by check or Dwolla, but a PayPal payment may have fees associated with it.

All processing and transfer fees (excluding the fees for paying the Teacher if they apply) are taken out of Freeside’s half of the class fee. These cover any advertising, administrative, promotional costs as well as the use of Freeside space and equipment where it applies.
Freeside also offers a 20% refund for members from the class fee, excluding materials fees. This is also taken out of Freeside’s half.

# Registering a class
Teachers apply to teach a class by filling out the Class Registration form (after having filled out the Teacher Application form exactly once). The information in this form will be used to market and promote the classes on the various social media channels that Freeside uses.
After submitting the form, the Teacher will be contacted by a representative of Freeside (Officer, DIrector, or delegate of the Activities and Culture committee) to look over their lesson plan, discuss the details of the class relevant to scheduling and promotion, make any necessary adjustments, and then launch the class. The Director will work with the Teacher to follow the guidelines for scheduling a class to ensure the highest possible quality and attendance for the class. This process will, in general, be greatly simplified for repeats or follow-up classes.

# Materials Fees and Costs
Materials can sometimes be required for a class. The estimated materials fee will be in addition to the total class fee, and paid to the party (Freeside or the Instructor) who purchases the materials, or shared as appropriate when each party provides some materials, but in addition to the Teacher’s fee. As a Best Practice, we recommend charging enough for the materials so that if only 50% of the expected seats for the class are paid for, the costs are covered. A 50% markup is reasonable and excess material should be either be redistributed for free use in the space or used in future classes.
If a materials fee is charged, students have the expectation of leaving with something. Teachers should consider this beforehand. For a 3D printing class, it is unrealistic to plan for 10 people to each get a printed part, so some should be made beforehand. Students that pay a materials fee but leave with nothing to take home have in the past had a much more negative opinion about the class, regardless of how affordable it actually was. If a materials fee is charged, students should leave with something for their fee.
However, if we need to stock materials on-site, we can plan ahead for that. People have come to Arduino classes without Arduinos. The teacher had extras and people shared, but we can plan to stock and sell these kinds of items with enough notice.

# Repetition of Classes
Repeating classes and class series are important for complicated topics, but can be difficult to handle. Scheduling conflicts among attendees can result in smaller and smaller class sizes as the class progresses. We recommend offering two versions of a Level 1 class before releasing a Level 2. But this is just a recommendation.
However, we will only schedule a class series in one-month blocks. Classes cannot repeat indefinitely. Each month, we can plan the next release of classes.

# Frequency of payments and refunds
Teachers will be paid for classes on the First and Third Fridays of the month. This will simplify the accounting for the classes and ensure that teachers are paid in a timely and regular manner. It will also give us some time to resolve any payment issues or discrepancies.
Members will also be issued their 20% refunds on the same days. The discount is not immediate because Meetup will not allow two tiers of payment. Members will have to pay the full price for classes and be compensated in the form of a refund on the First and Third Fridays. Members will bear whatever transfer fees apply in that payment (again, checks or Dwolla will be significantly less costly than PayPal or other costly payment processing system.

# Student Refund Policy
Students are eligible for a refund if and only if:
* The class is cancelled
* The class is rescheduled
* The student cancels 3 or more days before the class is set to start.
* The teacher fails to show up for the class
* The space is unavailable for whatever reason and/or the class doesn’t happen.
Students that register but do not appear and students that drop the class less than 3 days before the event are not eligible for a refund because it is possible that their registration filled the class to capacity, materials were acquired on their behalf, or the class should have been cancelled because too few people were registered. This policy is for the benefit of the Teacher, who we feel should be fairly compensated for their time in this situation.

# Summary of Policies
These policies are designed to make Classes at Freeside good for everyone:

## Good for students
* Basic information and a network of help
* Reasonable pricing ($5-$20 per hour of instruction recommended + materials fees if applicable)
* Reliable and organized instruction

## Good for teachers
* 50% take of all class income (fees are deducted from Freeside’s portion)
* Benefit from Freeside’s network of interested students
* Free advertising and promotion
* Administration of class is taken care of
* Space and materials are provided (classroom, projector, equipment, etc…)

## Good for Freeside
* More support for more materials, space, resources
* Better skills = cooler projects for members
* Good for Freeside Members
* Freeside members get a 20% refund on class fees (taken from Freeside’s portion)
